# Time Tracking App - Development Tasks

## Task Management Guide
- Each task has an estimated complexity: `[Easy]`, `[Medium]`, `[Hard]`
- Tasks inside a phase should usually be completed in order
- This plan is intentionally scoped for a personal-use product
- There is no organization or workspace layer; every record belongs directly to one user
- There is no separate project model; folders are the only hierarchy type

## Open Product Decisions
